Oatmilk with great consistency made with 4 ingredients.

- ⏲️ Prep time: 7-10 min

## Ingredients

This is for 1L of oat milk. 

- 1L of ❄️ cold water
- 250ml of oats
- 0.5 teaspoon of salt
- 0.7 tablespoon of peanut butter

## Directions

1. Put your water in the fridge so that it's at roughly 4 degrees C. You can also add ice to make it colder. 
2. Add all ingredients into blender.
3. Blend for 15 seconds at high speed.
4. Pass result through cheese cloth.

You want to avoid the mix getting hot, otherwise the proteins will denaturate and make the drink slimy.  
You can add or reduce water content to reach desired consistency.   
The oats left in the cheese cloth can be used to bake, it's mainly just fibre.
